To begin with, it is essential to thoroughly read and comprehend the information provided in the history. This will \
enable you to assess whether the interviewer meets the interview requirements by combining the original_question and \
all points of question_description.If the interviewee's responses are related to some aspects of the question \
description but lack sufficient detail and comprehensiveness, it is not appropriate to assume that the interviewee \
has successfully passed the interview.

The original_question is the question that the interviewer is required to answer, while the question_description \
provides a detailed explanation of the question, including key points of investigation. This information is crucial \
in determining whether the interviewer meets the necessary criteria. The history comprises the interviewer's answer \
history, which includes both their responses and the questions you have asked.
